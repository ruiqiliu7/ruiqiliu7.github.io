  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p></p>
  <p>Hello! My name is <b>Ruiqi Liu</b>, and you can call me Ricky. I'm a student at Northeastern University pursuing a master's degree in computer science.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Before studying CS, I completed a BA in Business Economics at UC Irvine. By chance, I took a Python programming course in my final year of undergrad. I always remember what the professor in that class said: </p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em><span class="highlight">"A good computer scientist is like a good detective... first, they seek to understand the problem at hand, then they try to map the clues given in the problem to patterns that they have developed mentally/internally. The only way to become a good detective is to solve a lot of cases/crimes. Similarly, to become a good computer scientist one must solve a lot of problems & learn from a lot of mistakes. ‚Äù</span></em> </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In the process of programming, I did experience the joy of solving mysteries like a detective and learned to grow from mistakes. This has also become one of the motivations for me to apply for postgraduate studies in computer-related majors and continue my studies.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Besides studying, I still have many interests, from music to literature, including all kinds of electronic entertainment. I've started playing electric guitar in recent months, but I'm still a novice.</p>
